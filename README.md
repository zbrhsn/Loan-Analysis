you are tasked with the goal of building a simple model to predictwhether or not a borrower will pay back their loan in full. This prediction will be based on various detailsabout the loan and the borrower such as the purpose of the loan, interest rate, FICO score, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors. Youâ€™re also responsible for developing some visualizations.
